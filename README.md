# Datasets for Computer Vision

## Description

I collect a set of datasets for computer vision and help researchers and students in their research. Types of datasets includes:
* 3d reconstruction (SfM, MVS)
* semantic segmentation
* feature & descriptor learning
* depth estimation
* pose estimation

Hyperlinks for downloading are given in corresponding folder. Besides, some links of open source code are given. 

## How to Use these Datasets

This repo is created for research, all datasets are open source and hosted on corresponding website, commercial utilizations are not allowed.  
## How to Contribute to This Repository

If the type of corresponding dataset already exists, you can modify README.md.  If the type of corresponding dataset not exists, create a folder with a file named README.md put in the folder. Format of dataset is listed below:
| Dataset | Hosted Source | Images | Size | Hyperlinks | Type | Ground Truth |
| :--------   | :-----   | :----: | :----: | :---- | :----: |:----: |

You can add some needed items and remove the item that don't need.
